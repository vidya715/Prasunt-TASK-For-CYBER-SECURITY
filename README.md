This caption succinctly highlights the key features and benefits of your repository, making it clear to potential users what they can expect and why they might find it valuable.

Here's a brief summary of what happens in each of the cybersecurity tasks you mentioned:
TASK-01: Caesar Cipher Implementation

    Objective: Create a Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
    Implementation:
        Encryption: Shift each letter in the plaintext by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
        Decryption: Reverse the encryption process by shifting each letter back.
        User Interaction: Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

TASK-02: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

    Objective: Develop a tool to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques.
    Implementation:
        Encryption: Modify pixel values (e.g., swapping, mathematical operations) to alter the appearance of the image.
        Decryption: Reverse the encryption process to restore the original image.
        User Interaction: Provide options for users to select images and apply encryption or decryption operations.

TASK-03: Password Complexity Checker

    Objective: Build a tool to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria.
    Implementation:
        Criteria: Evaluate factors such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        Feedback: Provide feedback to users on the strength of their passwords (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).
        User Interaction: Allow users to input passwords and receive immediate strength assessment.

TASK-04: Simple Keylogger

    Objective: Create a basic program to record and log keystrokes from a user's keyboard.
    Implementation:
        Logging: Capture and save keystrokes to a file, typically in a hidden or inconspicuous manner.
        File Management: Manage the logged data securely and responsibly.
        Ethical Considerations: Address ethical implications and emphasize the need for proper permissions and usage guidelines.

TASK-05: Network Packet Analyzer

    Objective: Develop a tool to capture and analyze network packets flowing through a network interface.
    Implementation:
        Packet Capture: Use libraries like Scapy to capture packets in real-time or from stored files.
        Packet Analysis: Extract key information such as source/destination IPs, protocols, and payload data from captured packets.
        User Interface: Present captured and analyzed data in a readable format, potentially through a CLI or GUI.
        Educational Use: Highlight the tool's educational role in teaching networking fundamentals and security concepts.
        Ethical Use: Stress the ethical considerations and emphasize lawful and responsible usage of network analysis tools.

Each task contributes to different aspects of cybersecurity knowledge and skills, ranging from cryptography and password security to network monitoring and ethical considerations in software development.
